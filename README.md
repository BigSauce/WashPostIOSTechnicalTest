# WashPostIOSTechnicalTest

In the time allotted, I was able to create a crude app which includes the following (in the technical-test branch):
* UI - articles controller and article detail controller
* Articles are loaded and parsed from the Washington Post Api and displayed in respective view controllers.
* unit tests

Did not have time to:
* implement sorting
* place the content of the article post in a scroll view and dynamically resize its content
* display the markup for the content appropriately

When you pull the code, you will have to run `pod install` within the project's directory to install AFNetworking.  Then open the workspace created from running `pod install` and build from there.

I had fun with this project, and I was bummed about the time limit affecting the look and feel of the app, so I made some small improvements with about 1.5 more hours of coding.

If you are interested in seeing these small improvements, which include, but are not limited to, implementing the functionality which I was unable to implement in the 3 hour timeframe for the technical test, then feel free to switch to either of these two branches:

* **what-I-would-have-done-with-an-hour-more**
* **what-I-would-have-done-with-two-hours-more**

Thanks for the opportunity to write some code for you.  Please let me know if you have any questions about certain coding decisions or even have constructive criticism about my approach.  I look forward to hearing from you.
