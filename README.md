# WashPostIOSTechnicalTest

In the time allotted, I was able to create a crude app the includes the following:
* UI - articles controller and article detail controller
* Articles are loaded and parsed from the Washington Post Api and displayed in respective view controllers.
* unit tests

Did not have time to:
* implement sorting
* place the content of the article post in a scroll view and dynamically resize its content
* display the markup for the content appropriately

Thanks for the opportunity to write some code for you!

P.S. I would have loved 5 hours ;)
